# Memory-Game

## Project Description:
Memory Card Game Pro is a web-based concentration card game that challenges players to find matching pairs within a limited time. The game features a modern interface with smooth 3D flip animations and a timer that adjusts according to difficulty level. It also stores high scores locally using localStorage, allowing players to compete for the best scores on a built-in leaderboard.

# Key Features:

## Three difficulty levels:
Easy (4x4 grid, 60 seconds)
Medium (6x6 grid, 180 seconds)
Hard (8x8 grid, 240 seconds)
The timer automatically adjusts based on the selected level.

## 3D flip animation:
Each card flips smoothly using CSS transforms and transitions, providing an engaging visual experience.

## Countdown timer:
Displays remaining time in real-time. The game ends if time runs out before all pairs are matched.

## Scoring system:
Players earn points for each matched pair.

## Local leaderboard:
Stores player names and scores in the browser’s localStorage. Players can enter their name before starting and view the top scores.

## Win and lose animations:
Win: screen flashes green with falling confetti.
Lose: screen flashes red with a shaking effect.

## Responsive and mobile-friendly:
The layout and card sizes automatically adjust to fit different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used:
HTML5 & CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Animations)
Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
Browser LocalStorage for leaderboard data persistence

## How to Play:
Enter your player name.
Select a difficulty level.
Click the “Start Game” button.

After finishing, your score is saved to the leaderboard.

## Future Enhancements:
Adding sound effects for card flips, wins, and losses.
Online leaderboard for competing with other players globally.
Real-time multiplayer mode.
Visual timer progress bars or circular countdown animations.
